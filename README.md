## Motivation

My main motivation was to try out generics in Go. I jumped straight into the usual suspects: `Filter` and `Map`. When testing these, I saw the need for assertion functions: another opportunity to exercise some more generics! It lives as an [internal](https://github.com/gtramontina/go-extlib/blob/main/internal/assert/assert.go) package at the moment.

Later I thought it would be nice to implement `Set`, and then `HashMap`, with which I got carried away and ended up implementing a somewhat na√Øve [hasher](https://github.com/gtramontina/go-extlib/blob/main/internal/hash/hash.go) (you can read more on the rationale on [this commit](https://github.com/gtramontina/go-extlib/commit/808ac8236c433587c4dc2f85479c1189a5df6010)).

When I realized, I was already having fun with `Maybe`, `Either` and `Result`. Here is where I stumbled upon some limitations of Go generics. Right when I was experimenting with it, I came across a blog post by [@hypirion](https://github.com/hypirion) titled "[Type-Safe HTTP Servers in Go via Generics](https://hypirion.com/musings/type-safe-http-servers-in-go-via-generics)" where the author bumps into these same limitations.

When writing software in Go, I've always wanted slightly higher level constructs, especially to represent business domain concepts. Some may say I haven't fully embraced Go. Perhaps I haven't ü§∑. But I sure know people who'd also like to go up in abstraction a tad bit.

Hope this is enough motivation‚Ä¶ üòÖ

‚ö†Ô∏è As the note above says, this is an experiment and no attention was paid to performance or allocations.
